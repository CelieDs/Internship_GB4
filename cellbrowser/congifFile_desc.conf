abstract = """The inter-differentiation between cell states promotes cancer cell survival under stress and fosters nongenetic
heterogeneity (NGH). NGH is, therefore, a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is
confounded by genetic heterogeneity. Here we show that NGH in serous ovarian cancer (SOC) can be accurately
measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE)
cells, the cells of origin of SOC. Surveying the transcriptomes of ~6,000 FTE cells, predominantly from
non-ovarian cancer patients, identified 6 FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC
expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of ~1,700 tumors
robustly correlated with survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic
stratification of SOC."""

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """ The samples were collected from the distal end of Fallopian tubes from six patients with HGSOC, five 
patients with endometrial cancer and five patients without cancer conditions. Single-cell cDNA and sequencing libraries were generated 
according to the SMART-seq2 protocol and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 Sequencer (Illumina). The R package scater was used to check the quality 
of the expression data and to count the total number of genes detected per cell (total_features), the total number of reads detected per cell (total_counts) 
and the percent of reads for the top 50 most highly-expressed genes (Pct_counts_top_50_features). Doublets were detected with the R package DoubletFinder. 
The subpopulations of cell across patients were detected with an in-house clustering algorithm. This algorithm required the expression matrix, 
preprocessed by log-normalization, selection of high variances genes, centered and dimensionnaly reduced by the PCA.
